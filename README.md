# CGPA Calculator
## For Anna University Students (R - 2021)

This is a Web Application which where we can calculate
our CGPA of our(ðŸ˜…annoying) results.

## How its Build?
It was build using a brand new [<b><i>Fresh</i></b>](https://fresh.deno.dev) Framework. Yeah its name ðŸ˜‚was <b><i>Fresh</i></b> by [Deno](https://deno.dev)
-
Im currently learning the framework and i also have worked with other JS Framworks/libraries such as React, Next, Vue

This was a little bit different and it was adopted a weird <b>Island Architecture</b> and many more Features

## Whats the Code does?
It contains all subjects's credit for every(8) semester for 5 Departments (CSE, EEE, ECE, CIVIL, MECH) which are stored in a variable.

It doesnt use any third-party services like APIs, Databases yet. Everything was served as a static files from a [Deno Deploy](https://deploy.deno.dev) which was serving this web project.

## Building From Source
Its a easy process to build it

1. Install Deno Runtime
2. Just run `deno task start` from the project folder
3. It will download required dependencies for the project  
4. And BoomðŸŽ‰ You made it
5. Now, it will locally hosted on `8000` port

Just visit `localhost:8000`
